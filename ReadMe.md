# Tlaxcaltin üåÆ: A Meson Subproject Manager

_Tlaxcaltin_ (plural of Nahuatl _tlaxcalli_, ‚Äútortilla‚Äù) is a collection of wraps and corresponding package files for use in other projects.
It is designed to be used as the source of all subprojects which a Meson-based project uses and can be integrated into a project using the following steps:

1. Add a file named `subprojects.txt` to the root folder of the project and add the names of the required subprojects to that file. These names correspond to the wrap files in the root directory of this repository without the suffix (i.e. the _stem_ of the file path). The dependencies of these projects are determined by Tlaxcaltin and included as well.  
  If there is no file named `subprojects.txt` in the project‚Äôs root folder, all of Tlaxcaltin‚Äôs subprojects are included, which is usually not desirable.
2. Copy `update_tlaxcaltin.py` into a subfolder named `subprojects` within the project‚Äôs root folder and execute `python3 subprojects/update_tlaxcaltin.py`.

To add new subprojects to a project or to update the existing subprojects, edit `subprojects.txt` (if required) and execute `python3 subprojects/update_tlaxcaltin.py` again.

Note that this adds the Meson wraps and the required package files to the main projects source tree.
Attempts to use Tlaxcaltin as a Git subproject have failed in the past, necessitating this suboptimal solution.
